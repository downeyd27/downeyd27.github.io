    	  <p>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer who enjoys collaborative environments with room for professional and personal growth.  I like being challenged and have learned to embrace the confusion that may arise with unfamiliar tasks.  I thrive on the satisfaction that comes from solving difficult problems and building meaningful applications that benefit society in a positive manner.   My goal is to improve on the skills I have already learned and explore new technologies that help me grow in a fast moving industry.
    	  
          I grew up in small town called Solvang in the heart of Santa Barbara County.  I found my way to San Francisco's North Bay where I attended Sonoma State University and was a senior manager for GNC (General Nutrition Center).  I found my work missing an element of fulfillment and decided to take a different path and purse a more fulfilling career in web development.
