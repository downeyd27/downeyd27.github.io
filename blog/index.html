    	  <p>
            I am a Full-Stack Web Developer who enjoys collaborative environments with room for professional and personal growth.  I like being challenged and have learned to embrace the confusion that may arise with unfamiliar tasks.  I thrive on the satisfaction that comes from solving difficult problems and building meaningful applications that benefit society in a positive manner.  My goal is to improve on the skills I have already learned and experience new technologies that help me meet industry standards for quality code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in small town called Solvang in the heart of Santa Barbara County.  I found my way to San Francisco's North Bay where I attended  Sonoma State University and was a senior manager for GNC (General Nutrition Center).  I found my work missing an element of fulfillment and decided to take a different path and purse a more fulfilling career in web development.
