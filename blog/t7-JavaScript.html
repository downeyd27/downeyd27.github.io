      <h2>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h2>
      <h5>02/12/15</h5> 
      
      <h3>Ruby Hashes</h3>    
      <p>
          Ruby hashes are a great way to organize and carry data. Hence hashes being called data structures.  There are a couple ways you can create ruby hashes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calling new on class Hash: 
          <pre>
            <code>
              names = Hash.new
              names[1] = "James"
              names[2] = "Sunny"
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Creating hash literal:
          <pre>
            <code>
              names = {
                "1" => "Sunny"
                "2" => "James"
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Ruby hashes have what we call key-value pairs.  As you can see in the example above the numbers on the left are considered the keys and correspond to a value by the "rocket" notation inbetween.  You can also use a colon ":" to separate the key-value pairs.  The key does not have to be a a number by any means either. It is more than acceptable to have a key be any string.  The above example could be more like.
      </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            names = {
              "wife": "Sunny"
              "husband": "James"
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
          Another thing to remember with key-value pairs is that each key can only hold one value, but there can be more than one key that has the same value.  To access information about the hash there are a lot of built in ruby methods.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>.keys: returns the keys of the hash</li>
        <li>.values: returns the values of the hash</li>
        <li>.store(key, value): allows you to store a new key value pair in the hash</li>
        <li>.length: returns the size of the hash</li>
        <li>.value?(value): Tests whether the hash contains the given value</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>JavaScript Objects</h3>

      <p>
          JavaScript objects look and act very similar to Ruby hashes.  In JavaScript objects are variables that can hold many property value pairs.  If we had the example of
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          computer = {
            ram: "16gb",
            console: "27 inches",
            CPU: "Intel",
            hard_drive: "100gb"
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
          we can see how closely they resemble Ruby hashes.  Don't forget the comma after each item in your JavaScript object.  With JS if you want to access the value of your object's properties, you can add .ram, .console, CPU, or .hard_drive on your object computer.  You can also access the properties with square brackets [].
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        computer[ram]
        => 16gb
        computer[console]
        => 27 inches
        computer[CPU]
        => Intel
        computer[hard_drive]
        => 100gb
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
          There is a <a href="https://medium.com/@prufrock123/js-dot-notation-vs-bracket-notation-797c4e34f01d">difference</a> between how JavaScript interprets unpackaging the property value when using the dot operator compared to the square brackets.  Say you assigned the property CPU to the variable "X" and then you wanted to access computer.X you would not get "Intel" but you would get undefined.  To access a property that was assigned to a variable it is best to use the square bracket method.
      </p>
