          Over the last eight weeks, I have been engaging in the blogging experience.  Blogging has been a great tool to help me solidfy my learning expierence over the previous weeks material, practice writing skills, improve sublime shortcuts, and it has also greatly helped me improve my HTML and CSS understanding.

          As I reviewed my blog there was a few things I altered after getting some feedback, but for the most part I kept things relatively simple.  The first major thing I implemented was resetting the browsers' default CSS settings for the majority of tags so that I could have full control over what each tag was going to look like.  Furthermore, resetting the CSS on all the tags for all browsers will ensure that whatever browsers the user is using my website will look consistant.  I also decided to remove my light green color background and changed the attributes of my links to be a little clearer.  I have kept my website relatively simple, so that it is easy for me to change in the future as I acquire more skills on-site at DBC.  Sometimes less can be more too.

          I researched bootstrap and got myself acquainted, but I didn't feel confident enough to begin implementing it throughout my website without a little more hands on assistance.  I can see how bootstraps grid systems is going to be extremely handy for sizing my website for all devices from phones, tablets, computers, and large computers. Also, I wanted to read and hear more about Jekyll from others, so I can make a better decision on which framework would better suite my needs.

          Having my website reviewed by others was also another expierence in itself.  Hearing constructive crticism can be a skill in itself.  You have to allow for some humility.  Sometimes what you think looks best is not what looks best to others, and it is really about pleasing the client and the viewers.  Furthermore, you have to take in the feedback and be honest with yourself whether or not the feedback should be used.

          Overall, I must be honest and say that blogging has been more difficult than I had imagined.  One of the most difficult things has been time management with my blogs.  Putting my thoughts together and writing has been one of my weak points in my academic career compared to the maths and sciences.  Everything comes with practice, and I have only seen improvements since begginning my blogging experience.
