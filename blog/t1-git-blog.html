          <strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong><br>
          Version control has lots of benefits.  First, version control allows you to safegaurd the original master by creating cloned versions of a project.  If you accidently bug your program, no problem, you can trace your steps back to a committed version that works and start from there.  Also, if multiple people are working on the same project you can have someone review your version before merging it with the master branch.

          <strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong><br>
          Git helps track your changes by tracking the state of files within a given git tracked repository.  This change of state is time stamped, and if there is a good comment when you commit the file you will have a good description of what was changed at each commit.

          <strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong><br>
          GitHub is useful for storing your code so you can access it from any computer connected to the internet not just your own.  It can also be a handy place to organize your projects.  If you have your code on GitHub then you can have others who have permission to look at your code as well.
