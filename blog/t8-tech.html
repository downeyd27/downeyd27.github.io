      <h2>What is rails in "Ruby on rails"?</h2>

          Rails is a framework for making web applications that run on Ruby as a programming language.  Rails is designed to assist you in making web applications by having built in tools that everyday web developers may need to reduce their code and increase efficiency.

          There are two major guiding principles according to <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">rubyonrails.org</a>.  The first is that your code should be D.R.Y. or "Don't Repeat Yourself" and second is "Convention Over Configuration."  Rails is a opinionated on the correct way things should be done and therfore set to their default settings instead of having to specify all the different configuration files needed.  This also leads to an easier to follow standard and allows more time for the developer to worry about developing.

          Some tools included in rails are great "out of the box" tools like JavaScript libraries, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming)">scaffolding</a> that can construct models and views needed for a basic website, a simple ruby web server, Rake(a software task management and build tool), and build systems for your apps.  Again, these out of the box tools are great for speeding up the web developers.  There are also many gui (graphical user interface) environments that help the developer manager their files, CLI (command line interface) and text editor.  Cloud9 seems to be a good example of a rails environment.
