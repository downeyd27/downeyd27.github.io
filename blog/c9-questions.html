        <h2>Asking Questions</h2>

        <p>
            Writing the perfect question can be somewhat of an art if you want to get a clear and relevant answer.  There are a few main components like the title, the context, the problem, maybe a sample code, and feedback
        </p>
        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p>
            The title of the page is going to be the first thing that people encounter, so this is where you need to grab the attention of the reader.  Pretend you are writing to someone extremely busy like Bill Gates and summarize your problem in a sentence.  Make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar.
        </p>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
            Making sure that you give the context of the question.  The reader will definitely want to know what language you are working in and say for example you are asking about variables in Ruby, you may want to specify what you are using the variable for and what scope the variable is in.  A poor example is to ask about "variable issues."  A better example would be to ask for "Variable scope question while working in a Ruby function"
        </p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            If the question you have regarding your problem involves code, it is most likely best to include the code you are referring to, but not necessarily your whole program.  Employers may not be so thrilled you are giving away their code, and if the code isn't relative to your question then you could be making it more difficult and time consuming for the reader to answer your question. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It can also be a good idea too help your reader recreate the problem you are having.  You should include, links, tags, language, keywords, library, or whatever information that helps detail and pinpoint the issue you are having.  You should also explain what you were expecting as a result
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            Getting a question answered doesn't stop at the moment you get a response.  Taking in the feedback from another person and diggesting it can be just as important as implementing the answer, so you can learn from the experience.  This can save a lot of time in the future by not having to ask the same question or a similar question later.
