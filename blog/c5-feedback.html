        <h3>Pairing</h3>    
        <p>
            Pairing with others on a challenge has been a new experience for me.  When I was taking a couple computer courses online, I e-mailed back and forth with the teacher for help, which was extremely ineffecient with time.  Pairing at first was very nerve racking getting to know lots of new people while working on new material, but so far it has been really fun, frustrating, and rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since getting married and working full time I haven't spent much time getting to know new people, so this has been a very exciting part of pairing for me.  It's really cool hearing other peoples backgrounds, and their motivations to go to DBC.  I will say, pairing can be frustrating when the sessions go upwards of two hours.  There is no blame for this, but regardless its frustrating when two people are trying their hardest and still can't solve a challenge.  On the flip-side, completeing a difficult challenge with another is one of the most rewarding things.  The other difficult things for me with regards to pairing, is talking over each other or staying focused together when hitting a wall.

        <h3>Giving Feedback</h3>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">ASK</span> is a great accroynm we love using at DevBootCamp when referring to giving good feedback.  "Ask" stands for Actionable, Specific, and Kind.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Actionable</span>: feedback is the type of feedback that the receiver can take and use to grow from the feedback. "We had a great pairing session. You seem to have lots of Ruby knowledge, and I hope we can pair again sometime."  A person can't really do much with feedback like this. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Specific</span>: feedback is just that specific.  When giving feedback you want to give feedback that refers to something particular that the receiver did or didn't do. "We had a great pairing session. You seem to have lots of Ruby knowledge, and I hope we can pair again sometime." Well, why was it great?  What showed off their skills that they should keep doing or you learned from?</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Kind</span>: feedback that is kind is not necessarily nice, but is given for the positive improvement of the person receiving feedback.  Nothing that brings negativity to the growth of the receiver.  "You made me feel inferior during the pairing session when you said I had bad ideas."  This feedback may not seem too nice, but it is still kind because it is letting the receiver know something they did during a pairing session affected how they felt.  </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Its interesting reviewing the feedback others have left for yourself.  I felt like most of the people I have paired with also enjoy working with me for my culture and communication.  I did learn that I have a tendency to get started on a challenge before a pairing session, so that I have a better idea of what is going on and I want to be able to contribute as much as possible when pairing and not feel like the weak link.  However, from feedback, I learned that some pairs may feel left out in the whole process if we don't both start from the beginning together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing feedback has been surprisingly one of the most difficult things for me to do in a timely manner.  I feel the pressure to want to give feedback back that follows the ASK guidelines, but sometimes it can be hard to switch gears from working on a challenge for over an hour to reflecting and trying to give feedback others can improve from.  I find myself rereading my feedback multiple times while asking myself was it actionable, was it specific, and was it kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pairing and giving feedback has been a really good experience for learning at a rapid rate.  Being able to get quick feedback before you go down the wrong fork in the road keeps you on track and not waste a lot of time.  Pairing with others on the same challenge has also been a great way for me to learn how others work and what kind of technics they use.
