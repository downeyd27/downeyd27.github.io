        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <h5>01/27/2015</h5> 
    
        <h3>Experience with Stereotype Threat</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Stereotype Threat</span>: "refers to being at risk of confirming, a negative stereotype about one's group." 
        </p>
        <p>
            We all have characteristics that make up our identity.  There are a wide range, but some of the most commonly seen are age, race, gender, social class, etc.  These pieces of your identity can be used to make you feel threatened when your characteristics are compared to the known negative stereotype for your group.  I don't feel stereotype threat as often as most, but I was in a fraternity in college for a couple years, and if I am around a group of people who have pre existing views of fraternities I feel that they may be perceiving me in a negative light.  Also, white males are suppose to be successful, and say I'm in a group of millionaires and I am the poor person in the group, my sense of belonging in this setting would be hampered.  This would directly impair my learning and performance of my interaction with this said group.    
        </p>
        <h3>Responding to Stereotype Threat</h3>
        <p>
            Stereotype threat will most likely occur regularly, but being aware of it can help you choose how you react to it.  If I am feeling stereotype threat, I plan on asking myself a couple question.  Why am I feeling threatened?  Is there something I am doing to make some else feel threatened? What is an appropriate reaction?  Can I communicate my feelings to someone? 
        </p>
        <p>
            If I suspect someone else if feeling stereotype threat, I will try an make an extra effort to address the said persons emotions.  I will ask how they are feeling and why they are feeling the way the are so maybe we could get to the root of the problem.  Maybe examples of how I have felt in a similar situation if it is appropriate, but it can be hard comparing two different situations and not always good doing so.  If the environment is intimidating, I will try and see if we can accomodate to make the person more comfortable based off of the threat they are feeling.

        <p>
            I think one of the most important things is to keep the communication open when you are uncomfortable.  If you do not make it public that you are feeling threatened in a certain situation no one else will pick up on it until it is to late if at all.  I think people will also empathize with your situation if it is known.  Most stereotypes aren't even true, so by addressing the threat we could try and break the barriers of the stereotypes all together.
