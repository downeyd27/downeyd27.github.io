        The DBC experience seems to be one created from everyone walking in the door giving their everything.  The whole community is raised when everyone is there with the same goal of trying to elevate others along with oneself.  Also, having a "kitchen" mindset and being proactive at taking ownership of your DBC expierence will be crucial to your success.

        So far I get the impression that DBC really takes to heart that they want to help good hearted people better themselves.  This really excites me because I feel like I will be getting to meet and know a very interesting group of kind programmers.

        I feel like I will engage within DBC culture fine.  I can be a little reserved at first, but open up as I warm up to my new surroundings.  I will need to make sure I keep up with social media and become more comfortable video chatting as more group pair sessions and peer pairing sessions occur.

        I am really excited to learn in this type of learning environment.  I have been taking some online courses from a local city college and I am already liking the structure of the Phase 0's handbook.  DBC seems to be embracing a learn by doing philosophy which rings strong with me and how I enjoy learning.  I am nervous about pairing with others remotely.  I feel a lot more comfortable speaking to others in person, but I know with practice anything can be achieved.

        So far my expectations of DBC have stayed about the same since deciding to apply, but I must say my expectations of myself have increased.  After watching the fireside chat I felt a little more pressure to do well and contribute as much as possible so I don't rob someone else of a better DBC experience.  Like many other things in life, it seems that DBC is going to be as good as what you personally put into it.
