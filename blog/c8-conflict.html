      <h2>Conflicts</h2>

      <p>
          The first major conflict I had with my now wife was when we moved into our own apartment a few years ago.  We had been living with another couple before, so that was nothing new.  However, it was our turn to make decisions about how to lock the front door of the apartment.

      <p>
          There were two options: lock the deadbolt from outside or lock the door from the the inside door knob.  Locking with the dead bolt took more time, but you had to have your keys and locking from the inside was quick, but risked locking yourself out. The whole conversation started with us leaving the house and going for a walk, but arguing over the sake of, which method to lock the door led to our quote of "I am not happy right, now."  Well, why wasn't I happy?  The fight was really a nothing fight.  It didn't really matter to our relationship how the door is locked, but it mattered how we were listening to each other and how we were willing to make sacrifices to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
          Ultimately, I conceded to my wife to lock the deadbolt from outside.  We talked over the pros and cons, and I knew continuing the arguement was really worthless, but I wish that when we first began the conversation, I was not so closed minded to my way.  Fast forward a year or so and I locked myself out of the house from locking the door knob on the inside on my day off which led to an interesting day to say the least.

          While analyzing the conflict, I feel like it was a conflict that really made me feel angry and uncomfortable with our willingness to compromise.  It wasn't really a situation where we could have it both ways.  The door could only be locked only two ways unless we wanted to lock both, which wasn't really an option either.  
      </p>
      <p>
          Overall, my wife and I have learned a good balance of picking your battles and knowing when to concede because ultimately seeing each other happy is what makes us happy.  If I could go back to the original conflict, I wish I would have recognized the value in my wife's opinion sooner than later.
