      <h2>Values</h2>
      <h5>02/06/2015</h5> 
          
      <p>
          In general I try and live up to these values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>heatlh</li>
        <li>honesty</li>
        <li>economic security</li>
        <li>nature</li>
        <li>fairness</li>
        <li>openness</li>
        <li>wealth</li>
        <li>loyalty</li>
        <li>reputation</li>
        <li>meaningful work</li>
        <li>justice</li>
        <li>stability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Most of the values important enough to choose for me to live by, I would give a 4 out of 5 for agreeing that I follow the values.  I feel like there is almost always an exception to the rule where you may not have been completely open, loyal, healthy, etc so that is why I feel a 4 out of 5 is most appropriate.  
      </p>

          Economic security is a value that has gained a lot of importance to me over the last few years.  I have been in the workforce since the age of 15 and have always seen the value in hardwork and pulling your own weight.  Life is not free and unfortunately to enjoy a lot of the simple pleasures that we do in our American life requires being financially stable.

          When I was in college, I experienced the starving student life and continued to live paycheck to paycheck for a few years.  I knew this was not the life I wanted for me or my future family.  There was also the obvious hardships that were seen all around the United States with the 2008 recession, which I want to learn from the experiences of others so that I can safegaurd my family against future hard times.

        Whenever someone asks me for advice one of my first responses no matter what the advice is for will be in regards to their health.  Working at GNC, I saw lots of people complain and give excuses for this or that and all they want is a pill to fix it, but the truth is you have to work hard and exercise and eat right to make changes to your body.  In turn your mind will also be changed by the physical release of chemicals in your body, which helps change your mind, which helps change your body, and so on.
      </p>

        I feel confident enough about myself and my values that if my values are underfire it won't effect me much.  One of my values is being open, and I believe that even if someone doesn't agree with me that is their opinion and that is ok.  It is good to have conflicting ideas now and again to reconfirm what you truly stand for.

        If I am feeling down at DBC, I am first going to remind myself of the short term sacrifices that return longterm benefits of DBC.  If I'm feeling blue, I will probably resort to some comedy whether it be online clips, comics, or pictures.  Laughter can make you happy and forget about the negatives.  Also, exercising when I can will be a way to release the negative feelings and replace them with good ones.
