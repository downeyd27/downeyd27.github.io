      <h2>Net Nuetrality</h2>
      <h5>01/16/2015</h5> 
          
      <p id="above">
          Most internet users don't really know how their information gets to them and frankly probably don't even care as long as they get it when they want it.  We have become accustomed to an open internet where no webpage is discriminated from viewing based on your internert service provider (ISP), but this basic principle of free access to view all information -- known as Net Nuetrality --is under fire. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating all content equal on the internet mainly consists of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality">WhiteHouse</a> four things.</p> <br>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">No blocking:</span>  As long as the content is not illegal, your ISP is not allowed to block you from viewing content.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">No Throttling:</span> Your ISP may not intentionally slow down your speed or the speed of others based on the type of services your internet service provide prefers you to see.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Increased transparency:</span> More free knowledge of the connections occcuring between the customer and service provider.  </li>
          <li><span class="bold">No paid prioritization:</span>  No content gets internet speed priority over another based on paying a fee.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Personal</h3>
      <p>
          We have become so used to an open and free internet, it is hard to imagine what a world would look like if we began to <em>slow</em> down the movement of information.  We have already begun seeing the hold on information with cell phone providers charging you based on the data you use versus unlimited.  I know from my personal experience restricting data can slow down a persons education and growth.  Many times, I can't enlighten myself with music, learn from a video tutorial, or even browse the net if I've reached my limit without seeing significant monetary consequences on my next bill.  Having said this, paying for a specific quanitity of data is not necessarily net nuetrality, but it is an example of how powerful ISP's are to our personal growth and intellect.  What about a blogger trying to get views, or a GitHub user trying to showcase their portfolio?  With out net nuetrality in place people who can afford to pay an ISP for a better connection to their site is going to be who's content is viewed not the quality of the content.  
      </p>
      <h3>Business</h3>
      <p>
          Net nuetrality is primarily concerned on how the data is being transfered or whether or not it is restricted.  Imagine a small start-up business who provides a superior service that wants a cheap website to increase their presence on the internet, but their viewers are unable to reach their site because of a slower download speed because they are unable to pay their ISP's premium price for premium connect speeds.  I could imagine this creating a very uncommpetitive business martketplace.  According to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">New York Times article</a>, "people will visit a Web site less often if it is slower than a close competitor by more than 250 milliseconds (a millisecond is a thousandth of a second)," so the speed of a website is very relavent to their success. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the view point of the internet sevices provider, not allowing them to charge IP addresses differently will slow down innovation.  ISP's claim the extra money received from charging companies can be used widen the network so more people have access to the internet along with incentivising them to research and create new networking technologies.
      </p>
      <h3>Government</h3>
      <p>
          One of governments major roles is to help provide a commpetitive, but fair business marketplace.  This is where laws and regulations come in to make sure everybody is playing by the same fair rules.  In the case of net nuetrality, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/openinternet">Federal Communications Commission(FCC)</a> -- an independent agency -- is reponsible for creating the set of rules.  As of now, there is still debate on the regulations, but many people are lobbying for the internet service providers, so stay tuned.
      </p>
      <p>
          Having a model where ISP's are able to control the flow of information will also create a gentrification on the internet.  Full access of speed and content will be catered to the wealthy who can afford unlocking that access.  Meanwhile the majority of the population will be hearded like cows to the websites of your ISP's choice instead of your own.  Bandwidth and speed will only be available to those who pay the tiered structure that the ISP's will create.    
      </p>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
          I don't have a lot of knowledge of what the right solution is, but it seems that the solution needs to include some set rules that need to be followed.  As of right now President Obama is urging the FCC --who really holds the power to create the rules-- to follow the four main bullet points as mentioned <a href="#above">above.</a>  I feel like it would be a very sad thing if only a few people working for a cable network companies have such power to control the flow of information.
      </p>
      <p>
          One of the greatest things about the internet is that the internet doesn't care who you are whether it be race, sexual orientation, age, rich, poor, or whatever.  At the end of the day I think it is best to want everyone to have a free and open access to information equally.
