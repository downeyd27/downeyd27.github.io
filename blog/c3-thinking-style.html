        <h2>What's Your Style? Thinking style that is!</h2>
        <h5>01/11/15</h5> 

        <p>
            There are many different ways of thinking and methods of learning.  Understanding and knowing what style best fits and works with you can be essential to your development.  Knowing how you think can increase the amount of knowledge you can retain in a shorter amount of time. Realizing how you think and best learn can also help reduce those stress levels.  Anthony Gregorc created a model to help people distinguish what kind of learning style you best fall within.  One of the most important things to understand is that you can be a blend of multiple thinking styles and that your thinking can change and evolve overtime so it is a good idea to come back and give your thinking a check. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            Anthony Gregor's has four major <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">mind styles</a>, two of which are perceptual quailties and two of which are ordering ability.
        </p>
        <h3>Perceptual Qualities:</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Concrete:</strong> thinking in the "here and now." You tend to be consciences of the information given straight to you from your senses.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> thinking is concerned more with using their imagination and are mindful of things you are unable to see. You like to visualize and see beyond what already is.
        </p>
        <h3>Ordering Abilities:</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Sequential:</strong> thinking is on a more linear pattern, prefers step oriented logic, less implusive, and likes to follow a plan 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Random:</strong> thinking is where you can organize in "chunks" in no particular order.  You may be able to work starting in the middle or the end and work backwards.  No particular order required.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anthony Gregorc found that there were four combinations of strongets perceptual and ordering abilites.
        <ol>
          <li>Concrete Sequential (CS)</li>
          <li>Abstract Random (AR)</li>
          <li>Abstract Sequential (AS)</li>
          <li>Concrete Random (CR)</li>
        </ol>
            Checkout Dr. Gregorc's <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a> and find out what your thinking style is.
