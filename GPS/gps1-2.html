      <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
      <p>A technic that programmers use to collaberate together to collaberate on 
        the same project.  There are two main roles for pair programming, including
        a driver and a navigator.  Pair programming bounces back ideas between programmers, 
        so that each is raised to a higher level of learning.

      <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
      <p>Pair programming for DBC is based off collaborative work. There is a stigma of learning by yourself on a computer but 
        real-world experience shows that working with others is more effective. Immediate feedback and learning from others is a
        priority for DBC. They're instructing us on how to receive the feedback constructively and working with others allows you
        to be more comfortable with being vunerable.

      <h2>Compare driver and Navigator</h2>
      <p>Driver: the one on the front line of coding.  The driver lays down the foundation of the code where as
        the navigator is looking at the larger picture.  Navigator will make sure to test the code and help psuedocode 
        throughout the process.
